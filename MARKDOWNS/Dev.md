# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Guide for DosVoces

This document provides an overview of the DosVoces project, including its goals, architecture, development practices, and recommended technologies.

## üéØ Project Goals

DosVoces is a polling web application that encourages users to share their perspectives through polls. The application aims to provide a platform for open, democratic exchange of views on a wide range of topics.

The key goals of the DosVoces project are:

- To create a user-friendly application where anyone can create, participate in, and discuss polls.
- To ensure that the application is accessible and welcoming to users of all backgrounds.
- To maintain high standards of data security and user privacy.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

DosVoces is built using the following technologies and architectural patterns:

- MongoDB: a NoSQL database used for storing poll data, user accounts, and other application data.
- Express.js: a back-end web application framework running on Node.js.
- React.js: a JavaScript library for building the application's user interface.
- Node.js: the JavaScript runtime enabling back-end development in JavaScript.

In addition to the core technologies, the project incorporates the following:

- Passport.js: for authentication and user management.
- Helmet.js: for securing HTTP headers and enhancing application security.
- Ngrok: for creating secure tunnels to the local development environment.

The architecture follows best practices for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It emphasizes modularity, separation of concerns, and security.

## üîÑ Development Practices

The DosVoces project follows standard web development best practices, including:

- Using Git for version control, with a clear branching strategy and meaningful commit messages.
- Writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- Regularly reviewing and refactoring code to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Following the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct in all project interactions to create a respectful and inclusive development community.

## ü§ñ Interacting with the AI Assistant

The DosVoces project incorporates a GPT-based AI assistant to aid in development tasks. The assistant can be used for troubleshooting, brainstorming design ideas, and generating code snippets.

When interacting with the AI assistant, it's important to provide clear and detailed prompts. The assistant's responses should be reviewed and potentially modified by a human developer before being incorporated into the project.

Examples of prompts to use with the AI assistant include:

- "Can you help me troubleshoot an issue with my React component?"
- "What are some best practices for securing user data in the DosVoces application?"
- "Could you generate a code snippet for implementing a RESTful API endpoint in Express.js?"

Remember to leverage the AI assistant as a helpful tool, but always validate and verify its responses before implementing them in your project.
