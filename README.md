## 🔧 Languages and Tools

<!-- TODO: 
Frontend:

Next.js: You could use Next.js as your base framework. It's excellent for building complex, SEO-friendly web applications, and also provides a built-in routing system which you can use to navigate between different views (e.g., main page, category page, individual poll pages).

React: Next.js is based on React, so you'd use React components to build your user interface. The search bar, category selection, polls, and vote breakdown could all be separate React components.

Tailwind CSS: For styling your components, Tailwind CSS can be an excellent choice. It's flexible and powerful, and it will let you design each component exactly the way you want.

Backend:

Express.js / Node.js: To manage your polls, categories, and user votes, you'd likely need a backend server. Express.js is a popular choice for this; it's easy to use and integrates well with Next.js and various databases.

Database: For storing your polls, votes, and user data, you might use a SQL database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on your data structure and needs.

Passport.js: If you're planning to have user accounts, you'll need some way to handle authentication. Passport.js is a flexible, widely-used library for this.

Additional Libraries/Tools:

axios: For making HTTP requests from your frontend to your backend.
react-query / SWR: For managing server state in your React components (like the list of polls, or the current user's vote history).
chart.js / D3.js: For creating the vote breakdown by country.
