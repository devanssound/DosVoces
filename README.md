DosVoces

Creating a Django application like DosVoces involves several components. Here's a high-level breakdown of the files and directories you might have in your project:

manage.py: This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your project in various ways. It gets created when you start a new Django project.

db.sqlite3: This is the database file for your project if you're using SQLite, which is Django's default database.

DosVoces/: This directory is the Python package for your project. It's the container for your project and its name is the Python package name youâ€™ll need to use to import anything inside it.

DosVoces/__init__.py: This empty file tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

DosVoces/settings.py: This file contains all the settings for your Django project.

DosVoces/urls.py: This file is a table of contents for your Django-powered site. It's where you define the mapping between URLs and views.

DosVoces/asgi.py or DosVoces/wsgi.py: These files are entry-points for ASGI-compatible web servers and WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

polls/: This directory will contain your polls application that you'll create.

polls/models.py: This file is where you'll define the data models for your polls application.

polls/views.py: This file is where you'll handle the request/response logic for your polls application.

polls/urls.py: This file is where you'll define the URLs for your polls application.

polls/templates/: This directory is where you'll store the HTML templates for your polls application.

polls/static/: This directory is where you'll store the static files (like CSS or JavaScript) for your polls application.

polls/forms.py: This file is where you'll define the forms for your polls application.

polls/tests.py: This file is where you'll write tests for your polls application.

users/: This directory will contain your user management application.

users/models.py: This file is where you'll define the data models for your user management application.

users/views.py: This file is where you'll handle the request/response logic for your user management application.

users/urls.py: This file is where you'll define the URLs for your user management application.

users/templates/: This directory is where you'll store the HTML templates for your user management application.

users/forms.py: This file is where you'll define the forms for your user management application.

users/tests.py: This file is where you'll write tests for your user management application.

This is a high-level overview and the actual implementation might require additional files or modifications based on your specific needs. For example, you might want to add a tags application to handle tagging, or a comments application to handle comments.

As for the searchable and taggable features, Django provides a robust database querying API that you can use to implement searching. For tagging, you can use a package like django-taggit.

Remember, building a web application is a big task, especially if you're new to programming. It's okay to start small and gradually add more features as you learn. Good luck with your project!
